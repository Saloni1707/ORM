# ORM and Migrations Project

This project demonstrates the use of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to interact with a relational database and manage database schema changes using migrations.

## Overview

- **ORM**: Simplifies database operations by providing an abstraction layer for database tables and queries.
- **Migrations**: Helps track and apply schema changes consistently across environments.

This project uses [Your ORM Name, e.g., Prisma/Sequelize/TypeORM] to manage the database and migrations.

## Features

- **Schema Modeling**: Define database tables and relationships in a declarative way.
- **Query Simplification**: Perform CRUD operations without writing raw SQL queries.
